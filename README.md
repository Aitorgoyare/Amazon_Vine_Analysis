# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program:
Since your work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was so successful, youâ€™ve been tasked with another, larger project: analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results:

### How many reviews were there in total?

There were 61,948 reviews in total. Out of that total, 334 were Vine (paid) reviews, and 61,614 non-Vine (unpaid) reviews.

### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

There was a total of 32,804 5-star reviews. Out of that total, 139 were 5-star Vine reviews, and 28,949 were 5-star non-Vine reviews.

### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

The percentage of 5-star Vine reviews of total 5-star reviews was 42%

The percentage of total 5-star non-Vine reviews of total non-Vine reviews was 47%

## Summary:

The analysis indicate a positivity bias favoring the Vine program. Looking at the percentages, 42% of the total 5-star reviews were 5-star reviews, compared to 47% of the 5-star non-Vinereviews of the total non-Vine reviews.

To demonstrate a statistically significant number, trend, or deviation from the norm, the results could be further examined by calculating the statistical distribution (mean, median, and mode) of the star rating of Vine and non-Vine reviews.
